# Object-classification
In this project, we try to classify images of two kinds of objects: fruits and household appliances. Four different computer vision algorithms have been implemented for four different cases. In the first two cases two models were implemented that tries try to classify different classes of home appliances and fruits separately. In the third case a model implemented that tries to classify images into fruit or household objects. In the fourth and last case a model was implemented that tries to classify every sub-class from both fruits and household appliances.
## Dataset
The dataset consist of images of five types of fruits and five types of household appliances. The different types of fruits and household appliance images are presented below:

| Fruits  | Household appliances  | 
| :---: | :---: |
| Apples  | Clocks  |
| Oranges  | Computer Keyboard  |
| Pears  | Lamp  |
| Sweet Peppers  | Telephone  |
| Mushrooms  | Television  |

Every class for both fruits and Household appliances were consist of 600 samples. 

We used the same model for all four cases.
