# Object-classification
In this project, we try to classify images of two kinds of objects: fruits and household appliances. Four different computer vision algorithms have been implemented. The first two models try to classify different home appliances and fruits separately. The third model tries to classify images into fruit or household objects and the fourth model tries to classify everything.
